###Intro

*FlightYogurt* is a YO app to watch your flight price 24/7 before your booking for free. Once the $ drops below your setting you will get YO â€™d!

###Story

In the past September two weeks before my trip from Boston to San Francisco, I was searching a cheap flight for that. Luckily enough, I found a flight which was around *$80* cheaper than the one I found the day before. Woohoo, I got a BOS-SFO roundtrip for just 288 bucks! So I was wondering if there is some tool can help people automatically check the fares without tedious typing and refreshing.

Also I had been told by a friend who works at a local travel agency in Boston that the travel agencies have a special channel to access cheaper tickets since they have a direct contract with the airlines. And they can hold the tickets without paying until the last few days. So once could hand off their holding cheap tickets, we could find a cheaper tickets on the OTAs, like priceline and expedia. This is a case especially for international tickets.

So here we go. For your upcoming holiday tickets, you can try to use *FlightYogurt* to watch them.
